### About Me

I'm Marziyeh, a passionate Computer Science student with a strong foundation in Python programming. I enjoy collaborating with others and thrive in team environments where I can learn and grow.

My expertise includes:

- <b>Programming Languages:</b> Proficient in Python
- <b>Data Science Tools:</b> Experienced with Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciKit-Learn
- <b>Machine Learning:</b> Familiar with PyTorch
- <b>Development Environments:</b> Comfortable using PyCharm

Currently, I'm working on my university final project, which focuses on the book <b>*Python for Programmers with Introductory AI Case Studies*</b> by Deitel & Deitel. This project allows me to deepen my understanding of both Python and AI concepts while applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.

Iâ€™m always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills. Feel free to connect with me!
