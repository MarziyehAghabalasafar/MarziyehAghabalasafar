### About Me

Hi there! I'm Marziyeh, a passionate Computer Science student with a strong foundation in Python programming. I enjoy collaborating with others and thrive in team environments where I can learn and grow.

My expertise includes:

- Programming Languages: Proficient in Python
- Data Science Tools: Experienced with Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
- Machine Learning: Familiar with PyTorch
- Development Environments: Comfortable using PyCharm

Currently, I'm working on my university final project, which focuses on the book *Python for Programmers with Introductory AI Case Studies* by Deitel & Deitel. This project allows me to deepen my understanding of both Python and AI concepts while applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.

Iâ€™m always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills. Feel free to connect with me!
